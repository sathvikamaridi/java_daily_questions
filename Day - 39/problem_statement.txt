In a train scheduling system, each station is stored in a doubly linked list.If a route change occurs, you need to rotate the list to the left by k nodes, meaning the first k stations will move to the end while maintaining order.

Test case 01 :

Input :

A ⇄ B ⇄ C ⇄ D ⇄ E ⇄ F  
k = 2


output :

C ⇄ D ⇄ E ⇄ F ⇄ A ⇄ B


Test case 02 :

Input :

Route: 1 ⇄ 2 ⇄ 3 ⇄ 4 ⇄ 5  
k = 4

Output: 5 ⇄ 1 ⇄ 2 ⇄ 3 ⇄ 4
