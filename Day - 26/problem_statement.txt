Problem Solving for the day  - 31.07.2025

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k â‰¥ 0.

Rotation to the right means:

Each element is shifted k positions to the right.

Elements that "fall off" the end wrap around to the beginning.

Input : nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3

output : [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
