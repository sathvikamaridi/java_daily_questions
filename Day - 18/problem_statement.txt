You are building a small Java program to manage the passenger list of a train journey between cities. The train stops at multiple stations, and at each station, passengers board and leave the train.

Your job is to simulate the passenger list using Java Collections, specifically the List interface (like ArrayList)

1.Add initial passengers before the journey starts.

2.Add new passengers at different stations.

3.Remove passengers who get off the train.

4.Check if certain passengers are on the train.

5.Print all passengers in alphabetical order.
