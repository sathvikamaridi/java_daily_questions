# ☕ Java Problem Solving – July 2025

Welcome to my personal Java coding journey!  
This repository is a **daily log of Java problems** solved throughout **July 2025**. Each program is built to reinforce logic, explore data structures, and simulate real-world challenges.

The goal is to improve **consistency**, **problem-solving speed**, and **clean Java coding practices** through small, focused tasks.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Problem-Solving-July2025.git
   cd Java-Problem-Solving-July2025
    ```

2. **Compile and Run Any Program**

   ```bash
   javac Day01_OddProduct.java
   java Day01_OddProduct
   ```

3. **Explore Each File**
   All Java files are standalone and well-commented. Simply open any file to read, learn, and run.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Practice Java syntax and control structures
* Explore data structures: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
* Simulate real-world systems (airline manager, fruit stack, senior queue)
* Develop logical thinking and code readability

---

## 📁 File Naming Convention

```
DayXX_ProblemTitle.java
```

Examples:

* `Day01_OddProduct.java`
* `Day06_ChocolateConveyor.java`
* `Day12_SeniorPriorityQueue.java`

---

## 📌 Git Commit Strategy

Each commit message follows a descriptive and meaningful format:

```
feat: Add Day 06 program for chocolate conveyor simulation
fix: Handle edge cases in natural number summation (Day 05)
docs: Update README and index for daily logs
```

## 🌟 What's Next?

This project is a **living archive** of problem-solving progress.
More advanced problems (recursion, sorting, file handling, OOP design) will be added in the coming weeks.

Stay tuned — the code continues tomorrow! 🚀
