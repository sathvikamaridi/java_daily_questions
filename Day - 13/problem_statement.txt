Revision for the day - 16.07.2025

A chocolate factory produces premium chocolates with custom names printed on their wrappers. Due to a printing machine glitch, some letters are duplicated in the product name. As the quality assurance engineer, your job is to write a program that cleans up the product label by removing duplicate characters (while preserving the original character order).

Write a Java program that reads a product name and returns a version of the name with duplicate characters removed.

Input:

A string productName â€“ the name printed on the chocolate box label (may contain duplicate characters, case-sensitive).

Output:

A string with all duplicate characters removed, keeping only the first occurrence of each character.
