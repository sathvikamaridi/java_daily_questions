In a package delivery system, deliveries are stored in a linked list in the order they are to be delivered.Due to a route change, the list needs to be rotated to the right by k nodes, meaning the last k deliveries will be moved to the front while preserving the order of the rest.

Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, rotate the list to the right by k positions.

Test case 1 :

Input :
List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5  
k = 2

Output:
4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3


Test case 02 :

Input :
List: 10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 → 60  
k = 4

Output :
30 → 40 → 50 → 60 → 10 → 20
