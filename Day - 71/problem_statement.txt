Rearrange Positive and Negative Numbers Alternately

Given an array containing both positive and negative integers, rearrange the elements so that they appear alternately (positive, negative, positive, negative, â€¦).
If there are extra positives or negatives, place them at the end of the array.

Test Case 01 :

Input : arr = [1, -2, 3, -4, -1, 4, 5, -6]

Output : arr = [1, -2, 3, -4, -1, 4, 5, -6]


Test Case 2:

Input: arr = [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6]

Output: arr =  [4, -1, 5, -2, 6, -3]
