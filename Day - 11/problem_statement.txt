Revision for the day - 14.07.2025

A fruit vendor stacks fruits in a basket one over another — like a stack. Fruits are added (pushed) to the basket and removed (popped) from the top only. The vendor wants a software system to help manage the fruit stack.

Design a Java program to simulate a Fruit Basket using a Stack data structure with the following operations:

addFruit(String fruit) – Add a fruit to the top of the basket.

removeFruit() – Remove the top fruit from the basket.

peekTopFruit() – Show the fruit at the top without removing it.

isBasketEmpty() – Check if the basket is empty.

displayFruits() – Display all fruits from top to bottom.
