Problem Solving for the day - 17.09.2025 - Corporate question 

You are given a Circular Linked List .

Your task is to split the list into two halves:

1.If the number of nodes is even, both halves will have an equal number of nodes.

2.If the number of nodes is odd, the first half should contain one extra node.

3.Both halves must remain circular linked lists.

Finally, print both halves.

Test Case 01 :

Input :

Circular Linked List: 10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 → 60 (circular)

Output :

First Half: 10 20 30 
Second Half: 40 50 60


Test Case 02 :

Input :

Circular Linked List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (circular)

Output :

First Half: 1 2 3 
Second Half: 4 5
