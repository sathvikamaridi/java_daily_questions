1.⁠ ⁠Chocolates produced manually by workers are added at the beginning of the conveyor belt.

2.⁠ ⁠Chocolates produced by machines are added at the end of the conveyor belt.

A function to display all chocolates in the current belt order.

InsertAtEnd("DairyMilk")     // Machine added
InsertAtBeginning("Perk")    // Worker added
