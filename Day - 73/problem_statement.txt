You are given a sorted and rotated array of distinct integers and a target sum.Your task is to determine if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose sum equals the given target.

A sorted and rotated array means it was originally sorted in increasing order but then rotated at some pivot point.

For example:

Sorted array: [6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15]  ||  Rotated â†’ [11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10].

Input:

An integer array arr[] (sorted and rotated).

An integer target (the sum to find).

Output:

Print "Pair Found: (x, y)" if such a pair exists.

Print "No pair found" if no such pair exists.

If multiple pairs exist, return the first pair found during the two-pointer traversal.


Test Case 01 :

Input:
arr = [11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10]
target = 16

Output:
Pair Found: (6, 10)

Test Case 02 :

Input:
arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]
target = 9

Output:
Pair Found: (6, 3)
