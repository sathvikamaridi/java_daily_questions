Problem Solving for the Day - 17.07.2025

At an international airport, two separate terminals display upcoming flight destinations. Sometimes, the same city might be displayed in both terminals, and the operations team wants to check if any common characters exist between the names displayed on the two terminals.

Write a Java program that takes two city names (one from each terminal) as input and prints all unique common characters between them (case-insensitive), if any. If no common characters exist, print "No common characters".

Test Case :

Input 

Enter Terminal A city name:
Chennai

Enter Terminal B city name:
Chicago

Output

Common characters: [a, c, h, i]
