Write a Java program to detect and remove a loop in a singly linked list.

A loop exists in a linked list if a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to a previously visited node instead of null.

Your program should first check if a loop exists, and if found, remove the loop so the list becomes a proper singly linked list.

Test Case 01:

Input:
Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 (back to node 3)

Output (after removing loop):
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null


Test Case 02 :

Input:
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> null (no loop)

Output:
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> null

Test Case 03 :

Input:
Linked List: 7 -> 14 -> 21 -> 7 (back to head)

Output (after removing loop):
7 -> 14 -> 21 -> null
